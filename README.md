Execution:
1. Installed nextjs with tailwind.
2. I have created component for each section under component folder.
3. Rendered all related files in /app/page.jsx.
4. Placed logo,images and related videos in public folder.
5. Used component rendering to show either passenger or commercial vehicle.
6. Used React Hook to handle state change for the vehicle.
7. Kept the code of footer and header in /app/layout.jsx to render across any page.
8. Made the page responsive

Industry Best Practices:
1. Made separate files for separate components.
2. Used key in mapping an array.
3. Used constant file for storing logo url.


Challenges:
1. Tried to used font-manrope but couldn't make it.
2. Animation and vertical slider work is pending under vehicle component.
